elevate-lab-SQL-Task-2

This repository contains my hands-on work with SQLite during my ELEVATE LAB INTERNSHIP.  
I explored database concepts using both SQL queries and graphical tools (grid view), applying them to tasks like table creation, data manipulation, and query writing.

 Working with SQLite

I used two main approaches to manage and interact with the database:

 1. SQL Queries (Manual Method)

What I did:  
Wrote SQL commands such as:
- `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Used conditions like `LIKE`, `IS NULL`, and `DEFAULT`

Why: 
- Gives me full control over how data is handled  
- Useful for testing logic and running batch operations  

 2. GUI / Grid View (Using SQLite Tools)

What I did: 
Used tools like DB Browser for SQLite to:
- Open `.db` files
- View and edit tables in spreadsheet-style format
- Add or modify data directly in the grid interface

Why:  
- Easier to visualize data  
- Quick for making small edits or verifying results
